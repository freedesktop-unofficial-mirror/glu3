/**
 * Generate indexed drawing primitives for a rectangular mesh.
 *
 * Generates a sequence of \c GL_TRANGLE_STRIP primitives to draw a rectangular
 * mesh with the specified parameters.  Each triangle strip generated will be
 * of the form:
 *
 * (i*width)+0, ((i+1) *width)+0, (i*width)+1, ((i+1) *width)+1, ...
 * (i*width)+(cols-1), ((i+1) *width)+(cols-1)
 *
 * where \c i is the index of the row being generated, starting from 0.
 *
 * The triangle strips are generated in row-major order.
 *
 * \param rows      Number of rows of primitives in the mesh.  This value must
 *                  be at least 1.  Note that if there are \c rows of
 *                  primitives, there must be at least \c rows + 1 of vertices.
 * \param cols      Number of columns of primitives in the mesh.  This value
 *                  must be at least 1.  Note that if there are \c cols of
 *                  primitives, there must be at least \c cols + 1 of vertices.
 * \param width     Width, in vertices, of the underlying mesh data.  If
 *                  \c width is greater than \c cols, data for a submesh within
 *                  a larger primitive can be generated.  If \c width is less
 *                  than \c cols, the results are undefined (and probably
 *                  wrong).
 * \param begin_cb  Call-back used to begin a new primitive.
 * \param index_cb  Call-back used for each index within a primitive.  This
 *                  will be called 2 * \c cols times between each call to
 *                  \c begin_cb and \c end_cb.
 * \param end_cb    Call-back used to end a primitive.
 * \param data      User-supplied data pointer passed to the various call-back
 *                  functions.
