/**
 * GLUtorusProducer decorator to implement call-backs
 *
 * To generate the torus data, the \c GLUtorusProducer class interfaces with
 * a C functions that uses a call-back mechanism.  This call-backs is
 * analogous to \c vertex_batch method that \c GLUshapeConsumer subclasses
 * will provide.
 *
 * However, this method is \c protected.  As a result the non-class call-back
 * functions cannot call this method unless it is a \c friend function.  It is
 * undesireable to expose this implementation detail in the application-facing
 * header file.  This can be worked around by creating a dummy subclass of \c
 * GLUshapeConsumer that only contains the \c friend function declaration.
 * Pointers to \c GLUshapeConsumer objects can be cast to pointers to
 * \c GLUconsumerFriend objects without side-effect.
 *
 * This is arguably a mis-use of the "decorator" pattern, but it is the most
 * efficient way to do this.
