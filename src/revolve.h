/**
 * Generate a surface of revolution

 * \param points      Points that define the outline of the shape to be
 *                    revolved.
 * \param normals     Initial per-vertex normals.
 * \param u           Per-vertex position in parameter-space along the u-axis.
 * \param num_points  Number of points in \c points, \c normals, and \c u.
 * \param axis        Axis around which to rotate.
 * \param steps       Total number of steps to rotate through.  The angle of
 *                    rotation at the first step will be \c start_angle, and
 *                    the angle of rotation at the last step will be
 *                    \c end_angle.
 * \param start_angle Initial angle of rotation.
 * \param end_angle   Final angle of rotation.
 * \param cb          Per-vertex call-back function.
 * \param data        User-supplied data pointer passed to the per-vertex
 *                    call-back function.
 *
 * \note
 * Per-vertex tangents are generate based on the assumption that all of the
 * initial vertices lie within the X-Y plane and that the axis of revolution
 * also lies within the X-Y plane.
