/**
 * GLUsphereProducer decorator to implement call-backs
 *
 * To generate the sphere data, the \c GLUsphereProducer class interfaces with
 * various C functions that use a call-back mechanism.  These call-backs are
 * analogous the \c emit_vertex, \c emit_begin, \c emit_index, and \c emit_end
 * methods that \c GLUsphereProducer subclasses will provide.
 *
 * However, these methods are all \c protected.  As a result the non-class
 * call-back functions cannot call these methods unless they are \c friend
 * functions.  It is undesireable to expose the implementation detail in the
 * application-facing header file.  This can be worked around by creating a
 * dummy subclass of \c GLUsphereProducer that only contains the \c friend
 * function declarations.  Pointers to \c GLUsphereProducer objects can be
 * cast to pointers to \c GLUsphereFriend objects without side-effect.
 *
 * This is arguably a mis-use of the "decorator" pattern, but it is the most
 * efficient way to do this.
